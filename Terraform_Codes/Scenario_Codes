1. How to create multiple instances in terraform with Unique names?

provider "aws" {
  region = "ap-south-1"
}

resource "aws_instance" "instances" {
  instance_type = "t2.micro"
  ami           = "ami-0b7207e48d1b6c06f"  # Replace with a valid AMI ID
  count         = 10 #This value defines no.of instances will be created.

  tags = {
    Name = "Instance-${count.index + 1}" #This will generate instances names as Instance-1, Instance-2 like that upto count value.
  }
}

output "instance_public_ip" {
  value = aws_instance.instances[*].public_ip
}


2. How to create multiple instances with different names and different sizes ? 

provider "aws"{
region = "ap-south-1"
}

resource "aws_instance" "one"{
for_each = {
Dev = {name = "First_instance" , instance_type = "t2.micro"}
Prod = {name = "Production_Instance", instance_type = "t2.large"}
Test = {name = "Testing_Instance", instance_type = "t2.medium"}
}
ami = "ami-0b7207e48d1b6c06f"
instance_type = each.value.instance_type
tags = {Name = each.value.name
}
}

3. How to create Multiple Instances in Multiple Regions ? 

provider "aws"{
alias = "ap-south-1"
region = "ap-south-1"
}

provider "aws"{
alias = "ap-west-1"
region = "ap-west-1"
}


resource "aws_instance" "first_AZ"{
instance_type = "t2.micro"
provider = aws.ap-south-1
ami = "ami-0b7207e48d1b6c06f"
tags = {Name = "Region_1_Instance"
}
}


resource "aws_instance" "second_AZ"{
instance_type = "t2.micro"
provider = aws.ap-west-1
ami = "ami-0b7207e48d1b6c06f"
tags = {Name = "Region_2_Instance"
}
}

4. What is Data Resource in terraform ? 

DataResource block in Terrafform is used to read information about the existing infrastrcuture,

Either 1.Resources created outside Terraform (like manually created in AWS Console)
       2.resources created by Terraform in another module

Note: It’s read-only — you can’t change or manage the resource with a data block. You’re just fetching its details for use elsewhere.

  provider "aws" {
  region = "ap-south-1"
  }

  data "aws_instance" "Testing" {
  instance_id = "i-0d13936c1bd76d83c"
  }

  output "instance_public_ip" {
  value = data.aws_instance.Testing.public_ip
  }

  output "instance_private_ip" {
  value = data.aws_instance.Testing.private_ip
  }

  output "instance_type" {
  value = data.aws_instance.Testing.instance_type
  }

5. How to select OS image automatically and create instances based on the images ? 

      provider "aws"{
      region = "ap-south-1"
    }
      data "aws_ami" "latest_amazon_linux" {
      most_recent = true
      owners      = ["amazon"]

      filter {
      name   = "name"
      values = ["amzn2-ami-hvm-*-x86_64-gp2"]
      }

      filter {
      name   = "virtualization-type"
      values = ["hvm"]
     }
    }

    resource "aws_instance" "example" {
    ami           = data.aws_ami.latest_amazon_linux.id
    instance_type = "t2.micro"
    tags = {
    Name = "dynamic-ami-instance"
  }
}
