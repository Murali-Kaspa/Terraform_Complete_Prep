1. Terraform Instance Creation from EC2-Instance.

	When you want to create an instance from an ec2-instancce with the Keypair. We need to follow below steps.

	First we need to copy the key pair from our local system to our instance by using below command.

	Step-1:

	Connect your instance through terminal.

	Step-2:

	We run this command from our terminal without connecting it to instance.

	scp -i /Users/muralikrishnakaspa/Desktop/AWS-Files/KeyFiles/Macbook_Keypair.pem /Users/muralikrishnakaspa/Desktop/AWS-Files/KeyFiles/Macbook_Keypair.pem ec2-user@43.204.234.152:/home/ec2-user/PROJECT/

	Step-3:

	Once the Key Pair was Copied, install terraform in your instance.

	sudo yum install -y yum-utils shadow-utils
	sudo yum-config-manager --add-repo https://rpm.releases.hashicorp.com/AmazonLinux/hashicorp.repo
	sudo yum -y install terraform

	Step-4:

	Create a main.tf file and write your logic here. To create an instance with KeyPair.

	Step-5:

	We have Private Key in your Local System, But we need to generate Public Key based on this Private Key. The below command will generate a Public key.

	ssh-keygen -y -f /path/to/Macbook_Keypair.pem > Macbook_Keypair.pub

	Step-6:

	Now run terraform plan and terraform apply.


		Main.tf: 

		provider "aws" {
		  region = "ap-south-1"
		}

		resource "aws_instance" "one" {
  		ami           = "ami-0fd05997b4dff7aac"
  		instance_type = "t2.micro"
  		key_name      = aws_key_pair.my_key.key_name
  		tags = { Name = "MYPRACTISE"
 		 }
		}

		resource "aws_key_pair" "my_key" {
  		key_name   = "Macbook_Keypair.pem"
  		public_key = file("/home/ec2-user/TERRAFORM/Macbook_Keypairr.pub")
		}		
=====================================================================================

2. I Accidentally Deleted my StateFile, How can I retrieve it ?


If you remove state file terraform will not even destroy the resources which was created by apply command.

We can import the state file by using IMPORT Command.

terraform import aws_instance.MYPRACTISE2 i-0d1abe6e6923a236d

MYPRACTISE => It is the Name of the Instance.

In your main.tf you have to changes instance resource as “aws_instance” “MYPRACTISE2”.

Now you run terraform apply command and verify the state file.
