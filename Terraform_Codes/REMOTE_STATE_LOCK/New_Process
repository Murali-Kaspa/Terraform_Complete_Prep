########  New Process ######.

In the other files we could see, we need to create S3 bucket to store the state file and Dynamo Db to lock the code, 
So with the latest terraform release we don't require Dynamo DB to lock the state. We can do it in S3 itself.

main.tf 

provider "aws"{
region = "ap-south-1"
}

resource "aws_instance" "one"{
count = 2
  instance_type = "t2.micro"
ami = "ami-05fa46471b02db0ce"
tags = {Name = "INSTANCRFROMTF"
}
}

resource "aws_s3_bucket" "bucket"{
bucket = "uuunqbuckta"
}

backend.tf

terraform{
backend "s3"{
bucket = "uuunqbuckta"
key = "murali/terraform.tfstate"
region = "ap-south-1"
encrypt = true
use_lockfile = true
}
}
